# MiniMusicPlaylist ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶
Hello Friends ðŸ˜„
In the journey of learning web Technologies recently I developed a Mini Project called Musicplaylist.
Tech stack:
        Frontend:
        Html,Css,Js.
        Backend:
        Express,MongoDB
This mini musicplaylist UI is designed using html,css,js.
The Home Page contains nav bar consisting of Sections Home,Login,SignUp,Explore.
The Home page displays the theme of project and some trending Language based music playlists.
When user logins it dsiplays a greeting message mentioning their name.
To store the user credentials I used mongodb to store user login credentials.
And used express for routing purpose.
In the explore section also we can explore songs based on languages like Telugu,Hindi,Punjabi,Tamil.

Finally deployed project using:
Frontend:Vercel
Backend:Render
To experience the mini-playlist:https://musicplaylist-backend.onrender.com/

Future view:
        Is to create a album section where user can add,delete albums.
        And also user can add,or delete songs.
        So that when user login with their account they can listen to their own albums,playlists.
