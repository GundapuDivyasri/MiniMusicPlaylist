# MiniMusicPlaylist 🎶🎶
Hello Friends 😄
In the journey of learning web Technologies recently I developed a Mini Project called Musicplaylist.
Tech stack:
        Frontend:
        Html,Css,Js.
        Backend:
        Express,MongoDB
This mini musicplaylist UI is designed using html,css,js.
The Home Page contains nav bar consisting of Sections Home,Login,SignUp,Explore.
The Home displays the theme of project and some trending Lnaguage based music playlists.
To store the user credentials I used mongodb to store user login credentials.
And used express for routing purpose.
In the explore section also we can explore songs based on languages like Telugu,Hindi,Punjabi,Tamil.

Finally deployed project using:
Frontend:Vercel
Backend:Render

Future view:
        Is to create a album section where user can add,delete albums.
        And also user can add,or delete songs.
        So that when user login with their account they can listen to their own albums,playlists.
